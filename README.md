## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable insights into developing responsive web layouts. One significant learning was the importance of utilizing Flexbox instead of relying on inline-block elements, which often led to various layout issues. Here's a snippet demonstrating the use of Flexbox for creating a responsive layout:

```css
#card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

#price-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```
